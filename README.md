# parseMeteorologicalData
This program will help you create a database of point
historical meteorological data in the desired location. The program takes data from the site "https://www.gismeteo.ru/diary/". And creates a database with the speed and direction of the wind, the presence of precipitation and pressure.
To create a database, you need to specify cityId = "227639 /", which can be taken from the address line and allYears = ["2015"] to use the required years.
